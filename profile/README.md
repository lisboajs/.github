## [üòç Give a talk at LisboaJS](https://github.com/lisboajs/community/issues/new/choose)
This is a way of giving back to our local community and to help us grow. We welcome and encourage speakers that are passing by our city to pitch us a talk. We'll take you for good food afterwards.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
